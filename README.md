# binaryConstraintSolver
Binary constraint solvers, using 2-way branching I wrote as an assignment for the constraint programming class I took during my MSc
Implementations using Forward Checking and MAC3 are included, both with the option of using various heuristics, both dynamic and static. 
Credit goes to [Ian Miguel](https://ianm.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) for writing the `BinaryCSPReader`, `LangordsGenerator`, `SudokuGenerator` and `QueensGenerator` classes.
